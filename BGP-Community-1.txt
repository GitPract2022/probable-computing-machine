R6(config-router)#neighbor 172.16.2.1 route-map RM-community-filter ?
  in   Apply map to incoming routes
  out  Apply map to outbound routes
==================================================

Deployment:

– Tag networks 11.11.11.0/24 and 33.33.33.0/24 with a special community tag 55556:666 and filter them from outbound advertisements at the router R1.

– Networks 2.2.2.0/24 and 4.4.4.0/24 will be filtered through a route-map and bind the route map to outbound advertisement with the neighbour R1.
